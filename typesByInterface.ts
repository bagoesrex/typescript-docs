// TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases.
// For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value,
// TypeScript will use the value as its type.

let helloWorld = "Hello World";

console.log(helloWorld)

// By understanding how JavaScript works, TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts 
// JavaScript code but has types. This offers a type-system without needing to add extra 
// characters to make types explicit in your code. Thatâ€™s how TypeScript knows that helloWorld 
// is a string in the above example.

// You may have written JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, and had editor auto-completion. 
// Visual Studio Code uses TypeScript under the hood to make it easier to work with JavaScript.
